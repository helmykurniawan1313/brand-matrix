/**
 * Guards against CSV/formula injection: Excel/Sheets treats a cell starting
 * with =, +, -, or @ as a formula, and account/employee names throughout this
 * app are freely user-entered (any editor can rename an account). A name like
 * `=HYPERLINK("http://evil","click")` would otherwise execute as a live
 * formula the moment someone opens the exported spreadsheet. Prefixing with a
 * leading apostrophe forces Excel to treat the cell as literal text — the
 * apostrophe itself never displays, so this has no visible effect on normal
 * values.
